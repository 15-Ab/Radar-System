# IoT based Radar System

This was a project which was completed as a part of our curriculam.

Name  of the Project : IoT based Radar System

## Motivation for the Project
For the first time, radar was developed as a method of detecting enemy aircraft in World War 2. Along with the developments in technology, these days it is used in a wide range of sectors. In the last few decades, there have been significant advancements in the use of radar technology.

## Objectives
This Arduino radar project aims to achieve a radar system prototype based on an Arduino board that detects stationary and moving objects. The radar system has different performance specifications, and it is also available in a variety of sizes.

## Outcomes (Points how the Project will impact/ change human life/ technology and legacy systems):
The modern radar system is very advanced and used in highly diverse applications such as Air traffic control, Air-Defense systems, radar Astronomy, Antimissile systems, Outer space Surveillance systems, and many more.

## Innovations
In this project, we are going to design an Arduino radar project using an ultrasonic sensor for detection. An Arduino microcontroller makes electronics more disciplined.
